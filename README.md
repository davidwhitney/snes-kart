# Trainagotchi!

A love letter to Tamagotchis, and Tube Trains.

Live out your biggest platform controller fantasies, as you regular the temperature of your tube station,
watch out for rabid rodents, clean up after mucky passengers and dance the night (tube) away.

You're the new Tube controller, and you've got to keep your station in fine fettle.
Don't let your station get too hot, don't let your platform fill up, keep ever

* Trains raise the temperature of your station
* As passengers arrive, they also raise the temperature of the station
* If it gets too hot, people will start to faint!
